# burger
* This is a burger logger that was built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) that follows an MVC design pattern; Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
